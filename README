= Description
  A Ruby socket library for MS Windows.

= How does Win32::Socket differ from Socket?
  MRI uses the POSIX compatibility layer functions internally rather than the
  functions specific to the Windows API. While this works, it is also less
  flexible.

  There are several differences between a core Ruby Socket and a Win32::Socket.

  * A Win32::Socket is not necessarily overlapped.
  * A Win32::Socket can be organized into socket groups.
  * A Win32::Socket lets you specify protocol data, such as service information,
    provider information, protocol chains, and so on.
