= Description
  A Ruby socket library for MS Windows.

= How does Win32::WSASocket differ from MRI's Socket?
  MRI uses the POSIX compatibility layer functions internally rather than the
  functions specific to the Windows API. While this works, it is also less
  flexible. This library uses the WSASocket API.

  There are several differences between a core Ruby Socket and a WSASocket

  * A WSASocket is not necessarily overlapped (asynchronous).
  * A WSASocket can be organized into socket groups.
  * A WSASocket lets you specify protocol data, such as service information,
    provider information, protocol chains, and so on.
